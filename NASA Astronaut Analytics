#In this SQL code, I am querying a database that is holding data pertaining to NASA astronauts in order to answer questions about the data.

#1. What is the average number of space flights for each astronaut?
SELECT Name, AVG(Space_Flights) AS avg_spaceflights 
FROM astronauts 
GROUP BY Name;

#2. What is the minimum and maximum number of space flights completed by an astronaut?
SELECT Name, MIN(Space_Flight_hr) as Least_Spaceflight_hr 
FROM astronauts;

SELECT Name, MAX(Space_Flight_hr) as Most_Spaceflight_hr 
FROM astronauts;

#3. Which astronauts have an average number of space flight hours above 10,000 hours?
SELECT Name, AVG(Space_Flight_hr) AS avg_spaceflight_hr 
FROM astronauts 
GROUP BY Name 
HAVING avg_spaceflight_hr > 10000;

#4. How many astronauts have a status other than Active or Retired?
SELECT Name, Status 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE Status <> "Retired" AND Status <> "Active";

#5. Classify the astronauts based on their average time spent per space walk into 3 categories.
SELECT COUNT(*),
