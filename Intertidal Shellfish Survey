/* In this project, I went out into the field to collect population counts of primarily Manila Littleneck clams and Native Littleneck clams within a historic superfund site post CERCLA cleanup. This data was then mapped using ArcGIS, analyzed in SQL, and then visualized in Tableau.

-- What is the total count of Manila Littleneck clams and Native Littleneck clams found in each transect?
SELECT Transect, SUM(Manila) AS Manila, SUM(Native) AS Native
FROM shellfish
GROUP BY Transect;

-- What is the total count of Manila Littleneck clams and Native Littleneck clams found in each region and which region has the most Manila clams? 
SELECT Region, SUM(Manila) AS Manila, SUM(Native) AS Native
FROM shellfish
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY SUM(Manila) DESC;

-- What is the most commonly found substrate in each region? 
SELECT Region, MAX(Substrate) AS Substrate
FROM shellfish
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY MAX(Substrate) DESC;

-- How many clams were found in Sandy-Gravel substrate? 
SELECT Substrate, SUM(Manila) AS Manila, SUM(Native) AS Native
FROM shellfish
GROUP BY Substrate;

-- Were clams most commonly found close to shore or further into the intertidal zone? 
SELECT Plot, SUM(Manila) AS Manila, SUM(Native) AS Native
FROM shellfish
GROUP BY Plot
ORDER BY Manila DESC;
