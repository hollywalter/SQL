# In this SQL code, I am querying a database that is holding Netlix data to answer questions about the data.

#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not TV shows)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of TV shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all movies and TV shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT
director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;

-- I wanted to double check that there were not more than one movie released in that same year, so I ran another query to ensure that all movies released in the same year as the "oldest movie" would be considered.
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <=
(SELECT MIN(release_year)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
