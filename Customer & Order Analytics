#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON customers.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE order_id IS NOT NULL
AND order_id <>''
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <>'Order ID'
ORDER BY price ASC;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID IS NOT NULL
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <>'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND orderID IS NOT NULL
AND orderID <> ''
AND orderID <>'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
