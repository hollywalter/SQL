# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

# Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity INTEGER NOT NULL,
danceability DECIMAL (4,3) NOT NULL,
energy DECIMAL (4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key INTEGER NOT NULL,
loudness DECIMAL (5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode INTEGER NOT NULL,
speechiness DECIMAL (5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness DECIMAL (6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness TEXT NO NULL,
liveness DECIMAL (5,4) NOT NULL,
valence DECIMAL (6,3) NOT NULL,
tempo DECIMAL (6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms INTEGER NOT NULL,
time_signature INTEGER NOT NULL );

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.


# First I determined the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT 
artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

# Then I determined the top 10 songs and their artists by popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Then I determined how many artists had multiple tracks and the average popularity for each artist.
SELECT 
artist_name, 
COUNT(track_name), 
AVG(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) DESC;
