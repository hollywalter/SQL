In this project, I took mountain goat capture location data from the Olympic National Park Mountain Goat Translocation Project and visualized it in ArcMap, created a new SQL database and tables, then imported the CSV files in order to analyze the data.

Skills used: GIS Map Creation, Cartography, Table Creation, Aggregate Functions

-- Overall count of captures grouped by the year completed.
SELECT Year, COUNT(YEAR) AS Captures
FROM captures
GROUP BY Year;

-- Which area had the most overall captures? 
SELECT Area, COUNT(Area)
FROM captures
GROUP BY Area
ORDER BY COUNT(Area) DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Which area had the most captures for each respective year? 
SELECT Year, Area, Max(Count) 
FROM areas
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year;
